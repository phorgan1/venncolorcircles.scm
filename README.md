# venncolorcircles.scm
A simple script file for gimp started by Akkana Peck and modified by myself to illustrate a bit about how you'd make an scm file for GIMP
Lets you go into File/Create and create three interlocked circles that illustrate either subtractive or additive color.
Just put the scm in your script directory and restart GIMP, for example for linux it would go into your ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/scripts directory
